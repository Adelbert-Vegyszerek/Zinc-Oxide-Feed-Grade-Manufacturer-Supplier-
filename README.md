The Importance of Zinc Oxide Feed Grade in Animal Nutrition
Zinc is an essential trace element that supports numerous biological functions in animals, including:
Enzyme Activation: Zinc is a key component in over 300 enzymes, aiding processes like protein synthesis, digestion, and cellular growth.
Immune System Support: Adequate zinc intake is crucial for maintaining immune defenses, helping animals resist infections and illnesses.
Growth and Development: Zinc deficiencies can stunt growth and impact bone development. Zinc oxide feed grade supplements ensure animals reach their full growth potential.
Skin and Hoof Health: Zinc supports healthy skin, hoof integrity, and wound healing.
Given these benefits, incorporating zinc oxide into feed ensures that animals meet their nutritional requirements for optimal performance and well-being.
